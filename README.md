<h1>Home Assignment DevData</h1>

To run the application, run file App.java in package com.tuananhbui.assignment. 
In file service.java, I defined a variable for api url, and I set "https://54.70.230.245:80/". 
I tried to send the requests to that url but I got the connection timed out error.If the url is wrong then please modify the "apiUrl" variable in side Service.java (package com.tuananhbui.assignment.service)
